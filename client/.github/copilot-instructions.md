This is a Vite + React + TypeScript client for a personal expenses tracker. 

- Use modular folder structure: src/components, src/pages, src/services, src/utils.
- Components should be reusable and focused.
- Pages should map to routes.
- Services should handle API calls and business logic.
- Utilities go in src/utils.
- Use TypeScript best practices and React functional components.
- Use React Router for navigation.
- Example features: list expenses, add expense, home page.
